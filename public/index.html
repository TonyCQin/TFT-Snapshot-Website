        <li>This is the leaderboard for the current semester of GT Snapshots.</li>
        <li>You must be a GT student or alumni to qualify for snapshots.</li>
        <li>The ranked leaderboard will be updated hourly, while Snapshots occur every two weeks at Monday, 11:59 PM EST.</li>
        <li>Snapshot points will be calculated based on the amount of players participating. 
          If 21 people were participating, 1st place would gain 21 points, and each placement below that would gain one less point</li>
        <li>Ties will receive the same amount of points, and will count as both places (i.e. tie for 1st will both receive 21 points, next player will be 3rd)</li>
        <li>Top 6 players on the leaderboard at the last week of snapshots will qualify for the GT Championship.</li>
        <li>Tiebreakers:
          <ul>          
            <li>1. Highest  TFT peak rank when snapshots are active (please record evidence of this!)</li>
            <li>2. Highest  current TFT rank</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Good luck and happy competing!</li>
