# TFT-Snapshot-Website

TFT Snapshot Website

This is the version that works locally. Add players to the playerlist in backend.js, run backend.js to generate the tft.json file in public, and then run server.js to open the website on localhost:8080.
The command list looks like this if you're in the root directory: 
node ./src/backend.js (after adding to the playerlist)
node ./src/server.js
